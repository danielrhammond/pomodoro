# Pomodoro

My super hacky mac pomodoro app that lives in the tab bar and doesn't bug you with ads or other bullshit like the ones in the app store. I expect the utility of this to be pretty much limited just to me.

## TODO

- Better appearance in status bar
- Optional global shortcuts
- Settings
	- Set durations for 
	- Toggle sounds
	- Notification
